# Purpose?

Own a baseball discord server and have trouble when people compete to select teams for upcoming breaks?

Worry not, use this bot to automate everything. Once a forum is created in specified channels in `config.json` , it sends two dropdowns with list of American and National Teams.

Bot notifies whenever a team is selected by someone and the team is removed from dropdown.

If someone accidently chooses wrong team? You can revert by using the `/revert_team` cmd (Admin only) !

## Installation

Refer to my general guide on how to run the bot [here](https://github.com/bilal-the-dev/How-to-run-my-discord-bots)

If you still face any problem, please open a issue.
